# Dough or Die

A player-vs-player game in a randomly-generated, physically impossible maze.
Players spawn on opposite sides of the maze.
To win, they must reach the other playerâ€™s base before they reach yours, fighting along the way.

The game uses typical `WASD` movement keys, item interaction via `E`, and `C` for the Cloning Self power-up.
All other iteractions are automatically done via collisions.

From the menus, the player is able to select whether they want to play solo, host a server for other players to join, or join a server.
If they select playing solo or hosting a server, the game will enter a loading sequence during which the map is generated.
If they select joining a server, they'll be prompted to enter the IP address of the server they are trying to join.
Upon entering, they'll be sent data regarding the map generated by the server host.
Players are then sent to their respective rooms on either end of the map.
Currently, playing solo is mostly for learning the game and not actually playing.

From their initial rooms, players are able to navigate through the maze structure.
The maze is made up of a 3-by-3 grid of chunks with pre-built rooms.
Each chunk has two variants, allowing for 512 possible mazes.
In terms of design, the maze is intentional designed in a way that would be physically impossible, with asymmetric doorways and overlapping room positions.
This adds to the challenge of the maze and adds to making learning it more difficult.

There is one easter egg room in the center (C) chunks.
For the A variant, it is simply a room that the player has a low chance of entering.
It has a one-way door that they can enter, leave, and likely not re-enter.
For the B variant, there are three buttons spread across the rooms.
If the player presses all three buttons, they get teleported to a secret room with a shrine of one of the team member's late cat which passed during the project.

There are four item pick-ups / power-ups.
The Ghost of Taft allows the player to turn invisible for a period of time.
The 2.5 of Spades increases the player speed by 2.5 times.
The Hydra gives the player the ability to clone themselves with the `C` key.
These items spawn with a 1/8 chance in each room.
Additionally, the Pizza Cutter spawns in set "Pizza Parlor" rooms and allows the player to deal damage to others.

For the cheat codes, we use the `ALT` key as the modifier key.
`R` shows the room name and numbers.
Just the letter `R` restarts the game.
